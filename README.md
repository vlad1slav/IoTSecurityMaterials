# IoTSecurityMaterials
List of materials on which to learn IoT/IIoT Security.

Before learning (and especially teaching) hacking or security in general I recommend to watch [How To Learn (And Teach) Hacking - Ruben Gonzalez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6IC-7Nx3r4).
Please also keep in mind that you don't just "learn IoT security", IoT applications has a lots of components radio/hardware/software/mobile/web and you won't be able to learn them all at once, so choose what you are interested in and start with it.

This material may help you regardless of what you want to learn

      <p>Not a hacking video. This should be viewed by Architects or Testers that also may report security usability issues. This talk underlines that IoT devices have different settings both secure and unsecure, users strive for simplicity so they usually use unsecure because it is easier to config. Suggestions are given on how to design security features configuration to be more user-friendly.</p>
